# malware_test
Caution this script pulls real malware samples but renames the samples to a random name with a non-exe extension. Use at your own risk only when permitted legally and with the permission of the system you are running it.<br>

This script has been helpful in testing the layers of a security stack. The result is a folder named malware with samples that have passed through the network stack all the way to the endpoint.<br>
